                        Planning a wedding or any party is tedious and time consuming at the same time. Consultation fee is our commitment charge for helping you with running around for your vendors.<br>
                        Sometimes, we have to physically go to your venue locations to secure bookings, pay consultation fee for some of your proposed vendors, logistics etc before coming up with a budget for your wedding. <br>All this running cost entails money and Sapphire Event’s time.
                        It is simply our service charge for taking the stress off you in contacting all your vendors, making bookings and coming up with a final wedding or party budget.
